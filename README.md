# traveling-UI-jetpack-compose

In this cuurent file which is only a UI for a travelling app. I have used ( and for the first time in a while) jetpack compose;after long time of being very insecure of  working with it which turns out to be very fun and easy, well more easier than I thought
in the UI, I have used :
- icons( of all types such as : Deafult icons , icon buttons, and some of my own)
- recycler view( which is currently called lazy row( or colmn depends on which you are using )
- chips were also used here
- modifiers ( which are very helpful for designing and changing sizes , shapes and for padding as well)

It isn't much of a work but for something I have tried for the first time , I am very much proud of myself and what I have created
